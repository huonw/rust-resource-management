# Rust Tutorial â€” CSV Summary

This tutorial walks through writing a program for summarising a CSV
file, starting from somewhere in the middle: a lot of code is provided
to focus the learning on getting familiar with the memory model and
ownership & borrowing.

## Structure

- `slides/slides.html` contains slides (compiled from
  `slides/slides.md`) that introduce and set-up some exercises
- the exercises themselves are in `src/bin`
- there are (example) solutions in `examples/`, which can be run with
  `cargo run --example <name>`
- `data/` contains some test files, including a Python (2 or 3)
  generator for large data
